/**
 * \defgroup swUart generic software UART (Universal Asynchronous Reception Transmission)
 * \{
 * Purpose
 * =======
 * This module, \c swUart, is a working example of an asynchronous reception/transmission (Rx/Tx) implementation
 * completely software driven and associated with another software driven module: \c gTimer, \ref gTimer with
 * provision for callback\n
 * Both modules are generic. They are mainly intended to work in embedded contexts which are _not_ extremely
 * hard time constraint\n
 *
 * Details
 * =======
 * Module \c gTimer run in the main loop\n
 * Software UART's run as state machines which are implemented as \c gTimer callbacks\n
 * This C code is portable (mainly written for and tested under \c GCC) can be tested on a PC box for evaluation
 * and ported on an embedded platform with available access of I/O line and a possibility to hook \c gTimer to a system
 * timer\n
 * Transmit and receive sections are clearly separated (so the optimizer should do its job and
 * eliminate what is not used)\n
 * More than one transmitter and one receiver can coexist: their respective maximum quantities are statically
 * defined by QTY_OF_SENDERS and QTY_OF_RECEIVERS constants which set sizes of internal arrays of management structures
 * in this module\n
 * Each transmitter is defined by:
 * - its configuration \ref swUartConfigurationT,
 * - a dedicated \ref gTimer, and
 * - an I/O function of type \ref swUartHwSetTxFct whose role is to set the transmission line
 *
 * Each receiver is defined by:
 * - its configuration \ref swUartConfigurationT,
 * - a dedicated \ref gTimer, and
 * - an I/O function of type \ref swUartHwGetRxFct whose role is to read the reception line

 * How to
 * ======
 * In order to illustrate a typical use of this module for both transmission and reception,
 * some code snippets for one UART are presented here\n
 * First implement <tt>void setTxOutput(swUartDataStateE s)</tt> and <tt>swUartDataStateE getRxInput(void)</tt> to
 * inform the module how to handle transmission and reception actual signals. E.g.
 * \code
void setTxOutput(swUartDataStateE s)
 {
  _setIo(XX, s==swUSpace_Low?0:1);
 }
swUartDataStateE getRxInput(void)
 {
  return(_getIo(XY)==0?swUSpace_Low:swUMark_High);
 }
 * \endcode
 * Then initialize soft timer manager, dedicate two timers for Tx and Rx, and initialize TX and Rx with
 * a configuration structure. Timer ID's have to be defined in header file: \c system.h
 * \code
const byte uartIdx=0;
swUartConfigurationT swUartCfg={
     nbBits:8, parity:swUEvenParity, stop:swU2Stop, bitWidth:4, bTripleScan:FALSE};
gtimerInitModule();
gtimerReserve(SWUART1_TX_TIMER_ID);
gtimerReserve(SWUART1_RX_TIMER_ID);
swUartSendInit(uartIdx, &swUartCfg, SWUART1_TX_TIMER_ID, setTxOutput);
swUartReceiveInit(uartIdx, &swUartCfg, SWUART1_RX_TIMER_ID, getRxInput);
 * \endcode
 * Follows a test example implemented in the \c main loop. This example constantly send the same string over and over again
 * and tries to catch what is sent to display it. Two strategies to used to read the incoming stream:
 * - #swUartGetChar to pull characters one by one from the FIFO
 * - have a look into the FIFO with #swUartHowManyChars, #swUartPeekNChar, and flush it with #swUartFlushChars
 *
 * Call to #swUartReceiveScanForStart is necessary to start the Rx state machine which is managed by the timer\n
 * It is interesting noting this example directly or indirectly calls almost all the methods of this module
